Structure.
Now that we have the projects added to our solution, let’s quickly go over what each is used for. 
The GroupBrush.Web project contains the OWIN components and Unity. 
GroupBrush.BL contains the business logic encapsulated into services. 
Many of those services will depend on the next project, 
GroupBrush.DL, which contains the database logic.
The Web, BL, and DL projects all reference their entity objects from the GroupBrush.Entity project. 
The GroupBrush.Cloud project is the project for cloud configuration, 
and the GroupBrush.Worker project will host the application in a Worker role on Azure.
